# segment.rules file assigns source code modules to specific banks
# segment.rules is constructed from any segment.rules found in the search path
# the search path is defined in Makefile.cc2430
# segment.rules get processed by a perl snippet listed in the Makefile.cc2430
# the processed output is put into the obj_* directory
# comments starting with "#" are supported
# perl regular expression matching can be used on the file name specification
# 
# general rules -- 
#  some code must be placed in all banks (or SDCC/aslink will complain at link time)
#  code called from function pointers must be in HOME/CSEG/BANK0
#  interrupt code must also be in HOME/CSEG/BANK0
#  code not marked with __banked can only be called from code in the same bank  
#
HOME intr.c  # All interrupt code must live in HOME/BANK0
HOME bus.c  # flash_read cannot be banked.
HOME clock.c  # cannot bank clock.c code because header file is part of core.
