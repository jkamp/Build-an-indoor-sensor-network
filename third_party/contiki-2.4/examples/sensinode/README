Sensinode platform example and test applications
 - by Zach Shelby (zach@sensinode.com)

This directory contains example and test applications for 
Sensinode CC2430 based devices. By default it is set to use the 
sensinode platform:

/platform/sensinode
/cpu/cc2430

To build an application:

make [app_name]
make hello_world

To build and upload an application using the Sensinode nano_programmer 
included under /tools (default /dev/ttyUSB0):

make [app_name].upload
make hello_world.upload

To dump the serial port output (default /dev/ttyUSB0):

make sensinode.serialdump

To configure the hardware model, you can include a make option e.g. for 
the N601 (N100 is assumed by default):

make hello_world DEFINES=MODEL_N601 

These make options are defined in /platform/sensinode/Makefile.sensinode

Descriptions of applications:

hello_world		A simple hello world app.
clock_test		Test and example of sys/clock.h related features.
rf_test_tx		Test for transmitting packets
rf_test_rc		Test for receiving packets
